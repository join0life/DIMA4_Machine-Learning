.\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any GPS .\\n30

exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n33

routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

this one .\\n36

  The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                    It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\n42

the travelling time accurately .\\n43                                                                                                                          Accuracy is as good as any other unit,

the maps .\\n45

airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n48

                 I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of

with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\n28

arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

.\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

  The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73

decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

determined reading .\\n63

inferior battery life in order to power a device, native backlight .\\n65

                       4,  I like that you can change the battery in the Nook and you can add a memory card .\\n67

all the memory or battery life .\\n68

                                                                                                         Oh and one more thing ,  I've discovered that if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .\\n70

.\\n71

on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .\\n73

                                                                                                                                                        I live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                   The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra £12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76

over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over .\\n78                                                                                                                                          The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .\\n80

                                          If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either .\\n82

your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

  The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

                                                   The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73

decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                               Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

                                     The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n80

     Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5

with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9

online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\n12

reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it

                       The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra £12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76

there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .\\n74

                                                              But the strongest feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .\\n76

six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77

outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .\\n31

arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55



The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

different room .\\n63

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

not an issue with me .\\n4                    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5

door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

                         You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9

the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult

                                                        As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus

                                       I haven't drained the battery yet, and I've been coast to coast with it, waits, etc .\\n51

  It is a big battery, and it does tend to tip backwards if fully opened and placed on a flat surface .\\n52

memory was a further contraint, and when I was done it was this model or an MSI Wind .\\n53

the outlet in the living room and allowed the battery to charge .\\n54                                                                                                                                                              Recently, however, my battery was about to die, and I had already set up shop in another room of my house, so I decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while I worked on it .\\n55

battery life is quite extensive .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                        If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n57

your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43



                                                                                                                                                     The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51



without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

different room .\\n63

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

     Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5

online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster

there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .\\n74

six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77

outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

.\\n156  One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

                                                    I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

.\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

different room .\\n63

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

not an issue with me .\\n4                    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5

door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

            It's also easy to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .\\n8                                                                                                                  You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9

the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult

                                                        As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus

all the memory or battery life .\\n68

to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .\\n70

on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .\\n73

                                                             The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra £12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76

over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over .\\n78                                                                                                                                          The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .\\n79

                                      The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .\\n80

                                          If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either .\\n82

things I'd like to point out is that you must push the micro, sized right angle end of the ac adapter until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge .\\n7

it is actively charging the battery, which Asus clearly mentions in the user manual, so one should not be alarmed over the heat output .\\n8

wouldn't go cheap and get less battery .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                       Deciding between the V series and the P series really comes done to how much you care about a slight speed different  , a small battery life difference, a better web cam, Bluetooth, and or the netbook sleeve .\\n14

                                                  Since the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .\\n17

describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .\\n21

understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .\\n22

running or turned on when using the computer .\\n23

with all rockets running .\\n24                                                                                                                                   I suppose that is one reason why I kept gravitating to the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU as I explored the reviews for other brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the

                           Recently, however, my battery was about to die, and I had already set up shop in another room of my house, so I decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while I worked on it .\\n55

battery life is quite extensive .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                        If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n57

feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .\\n76

with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77                                                                                                                                                               If your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42

bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43



nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51



without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                                                                                                                                                        We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73

decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

                                     The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n80

in to my USB hub on my computer to charge the battery the charging cord design is very clever !\\n0

took to get there !\\n1

and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   .\\n3

     Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5                                                                                                                                                           The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

                       So my only real complaint right now is a battery the end, user can't replace .\\n54

to full .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This feature uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                      I live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                   The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra £12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The battery life is unbelievable too .\\n77

even halfway over .\\n78                                                                                                                                          The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I just found out how to save the battery and you can read for well over a week without a charge .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                                                                       If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either .\\n82

tremendous battery usage yet .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   At first I thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff .\\n84

battery uncharged, but it charged up as advertised in less than 3 hours .\\n85

life, but I've only charged it once and that was on the computer  as far as I've seen my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if

you use it constantly like i do it only last about 4 or 5 hours not a big deal though .\\n35

minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .\\n17

annoying, and you get less than half the battery life .\\n18

noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                                  They didn't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some didn't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .\\n22

                                 Some complainers faulted the battery life, but didn't take into account what was running or turned on when using the computer .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The battery is drained more quickly when the computer is operating with all rockets running .\\n24

brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC .\\n25

difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU .\\n26

netbook to use on long airplane flights so the long life battery was a real plus for me .\\n27

on the back edge like the other netbook high capacity batteries do .\\n28

problems I feared so much have not materialized .\\n29

                                After almost two months of using my new Eee PC 1005HA I can report no problem with the battery, bringing the battery to a full charge   or the charging brick itself

                              My Jabra bluetooth headset works great with Skype, I've gotten 6 hours on my battery watching movies, listening to music   before plugging it back in .\\n33

                                                 Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .\\n34

              The backlighting is definitely a factor in the longer battery charge life, but it also makes for a very nice bright picture .\\n35

                             faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .\\n37

with upgrades to a six cell battery and larger hard drive .\\n39

it, portability, battery life to carry me through travels and for my teenager to use .\\n68

before I decided to charge it .\\n71

there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .\\n74

                                                              But the strongest feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .\\n76

six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77

outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

still a fine machine, battery life has started dropping off already .\\n80

your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157
